* Objectives
One of my main flaws is that I am interested in far too many topics than I can possibly explore in my lifetime. This website is my attempt to maintain a history of what I have learned, showcase the projects that I have implemented, and outline my goals for the future. I hope that any visitor to this website will understand how I can help you based on the unique set of experiences and skills I have accumulated.
* Work Experience
